= Uploadify-S3

This rails plugin allows file uploads directly to Amazon S3 (rather than going through your rails app). Useful for large file uploads/video etc. Especially useful if you use Heroku as your deployment platform.
                                      
This plugin uses the excellent JQuery based uploadify file uploader. More info at http://www.uploadify.com/ 
                                                                                                                                               
== Rails Installation (see http://http://github.com/contrast/rails-uploadify-s3 for rails example code)

1. Install the plugin
<pre>script/plugin install git@github.com:contrast/uploadify-s3.git</pre>
2. Set your Amazon S3 configuration in `config/amazon_s3.xml`
3. Ensure a crossdomain.xml file is configured in your Amazon S3 bucket
4. Use the uploadify_s3 helper method in your view
  
                                                                                                                                                           
e.g
		<div id="VideoGallery" style="display; none;"></div>
		<%= uploadify_s3({
		                  :file_input_selector => '#file_uploader',
		                  :button_text => 'Add Video',
		                  :file_ext => '*.mov',
		                  :on_success => "
		                    function(f) {
		                            $('#VideoGallery').html('<video height=\"250\" width=\"250\" src=\"' + f.url + '\" controls=\"true\"></video>');
		                            $('video-upload').hide();
		                    }",
											:on_error => "function(type, text) {
												alert("Problem during file upload type: " + type + " text: " + text); 
											}"}) %>           

		<input type="file" name="uploadify" id="file_uploader" />

** This simple example will work in safari (i.e .mov files can be displayed directly in safari). This is not a recommended approach for handling cross browser supported video online.
